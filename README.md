# Talk with Bob

Talk with Bob is one of my first ever times of using Java.

It was a long time ago since I made this but now I am writing this README.md

Talk with bob is a very bad example of making an AI chatbot. It's just If statment after If statment and I forget if it works.

### DO NOT USE THIS FOR ANY EXAMPLES OF AI AS THIS IS NOT AI THIS IS WAY TOO MANY IF STATMENTS
